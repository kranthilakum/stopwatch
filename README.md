Stopwatch is a handheld timepiece designed to simply measure and display the time interval from an arbitrary starting point that begins at the instant when the stopwatch is started.
The standard unit of time interval is the second (s). 

Seconds can be accumulated to form longer time intervals, such as minutes, hours, and days;
or they can be sliced into fractions of a second such as milliseconds (ms) or microseconds.
